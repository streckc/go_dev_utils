# Go Development Utils

Or development tools developed in Go.... what ever it is, I'm learning `go` and these are my playground projects.

## mod_run

A small utility to monitor a list of files for modification and run a command when a file in the list is modified.

```
$ mod_run "go run development.go" *.go
$ mod_run "python3 develpment.py" development.py
```
